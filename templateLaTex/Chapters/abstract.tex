\abstractEN % Do NOT modify this line

The report must contain two versions of the abstract, one in the same language as the main text, another in a different language.  The package assumes the two languages under consideration are always Portuguese and English.

The abstract is critical because many researchers will read only that part. Your abstract should provide an accurate and sufficiently detailed summary of your work so that readers will understand what you did, why you did it, what your findings are, and why your findings are useful and important. 

The abstract should not contain bibliography citations, tables, charts or diagrams. Abbreviations should be limited. Abbreviations that are defined in the abstract will need to be defined again at first use in the main text. 

Finally, you must avoid the use of expressions such as "The present work deals with (...) ", "The document concludes that (...) ", "apparently and (...) " etc.
The word limit should be observed, 150 words is the limit.
